Permissions Test Application
----------------------------

The project is designed to be a collection of sample code snippets for
discovering permissions available to a BlackBerry 10 application.
These code snippets are free for use in any desired form.
The app is not yet complete, and should be contributed to as more methods
are found. The goal is to be a collection of side-effect-free tests,
until such time as an actual permissions API is made available to
developers.

It should be noted that these examples are by no means authoritative,
and many use direct tests on PPS objects. As such, they should not be
considered future-proof.

The additional icons used within this project are from the Open Icon Library.
